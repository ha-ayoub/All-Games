    projectDescription1: `Arcadia is a project that has been close to my heart for a while. I had developed several
        mini-games separately, and it felt a shame to leave them scattered without real coherence.
        So I decided to create a platform that would give them a true common identity, a place
        where they could naturally coexist.`,
    projectDescription2: `Beyond the technical aspect, what really mattered to me was the experience: I wanted people
        to enjoy browsing, for the interface to be beautiful and functional, for everything to feel smooth.
        I spent a lot of time on details, color choices, animations, responsiveness... For me, Arcadia
        is not just a collection of games, but a polished web experience designed to be accessible
        and enjoyable for everyone.`,
